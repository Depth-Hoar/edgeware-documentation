# Edgeware Node

Blockchain networks are composed of individual **nodes** that are connected by a peer-to-peer \(P2P\) network. Nodes are the individual computers on a network running the blockchain software that makes everything work. The `Edgeware Node` subsection includes anything relevant to nodes on operating on Edgeware. 

### For node operators, validators, and other users

A getting started guide can be found at our [Github Wiki](https://github.com/hicommonwealth/edgeware-node/wiki), including guides for running a node, validating, and setting up basic monitoring tools to keep your node online.

For any additional questions or information, refer to our `builders-general` channel in the [Edgeware Discord](https://discord.gg/zdFJm4gA5M).
